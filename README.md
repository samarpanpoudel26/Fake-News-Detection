This is a Fake News Detection System built using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system is trained to classify news articles as real or fake based on textual content.

# Features
Preprocesses text using NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
Converts text into numerical features using Count Vectorization
Uses Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MultinomialNB) for classification
Provides an API for news verification (optional)
Achieves high accuracy on benchmark datasets

# Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Scikit-learn 🤖
Pandas 📊
NumPy 🔢
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) 📝

# Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing real and fake news articles. It undergoes text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification using machine learning.
